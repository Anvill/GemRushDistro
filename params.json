{"name":"Gemrushdistro","tagline":"For the distrobution of the Demo Gem Rush for Portfolio purposes","body":"### Welcome to The Gem Rush distribution page\r\nThe page is dedication to the distribution of an old project that I have worked on and wish to include with more portfolio. Gem Rush was a simple game made in 8 weeks by a group of students at DeVry University. Our task was to create a game engine from scratch in 8 weeks and have a playable demo by the end. I was in charge of our physics core for this project. It was my first time leading a small group of programers in the creation of a project. It was also my first time building physics from scratch. My team was also in charge of movement and collision detection.\r\n\r\n### Controls\r\nThe games controls are fairly simple.\r\nThe arrow keys are used for movement and navigation.\r\nThe enter key is for selection.\r\nThe space bar is for jumping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
